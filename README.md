# Old Personal Website

Old personal website built using React and Node.js, Node was used to query the Flickr API and send image links to the React App. I've sinced moved the website to a static website using gatsby [here](https://github.com/rorscharg/rorscharg.github.io).

*npm install*  
*npm run build*  
2. Install the Node.JS app dependencies  
*npm install*  
3. Start the App
